PROJECT NAME: name pending
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: A turn based combat game with online capabilities such as a leaderboard system and player v player combat. Our game will have an arena game mode for the battles, either PvP or PvE. Our database will store player character records and the wins and losses of each battle. The leaderboard system will compare each players total kills; the player with the most kills will be at the top. Our combat will allow the player to use multiple skills and attacks in order to allow each player to play the game how they like.
