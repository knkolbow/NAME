Turn Based Combat Game

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: A turn based combat game with online capabilities such as a leaderboard system and character save/load from database. Our database will store player character records, the wins and losses of each battle and player highscore. The leaderboard system will compare each players highscore; the player with the highest score will be at the top. Our combat will allow the player to use multiple skills and attacks in order to allow each player to play the game how they like.
