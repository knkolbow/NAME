//This is a rough rough ROUGH and entirely unfinished outline of fight AI

/**Presumptions:
class named Character that stores all our character stats
method called TakeTurn() that determines what the character does on their turn


idea:
use a strategy pattern, pass the character class through the strategy class which uses a series of ifelse statements to determine AI behaviour
can have three strategies, Aggressive, Balanced, Defensive

example:**/

public abstract class PlayerCombatStrategy{
  \\This is the class that the character passes through, this is an
  \\abstract class mainly used to get the character class into the
  \\other strategy classes
 
  public abstract void TakeTurn(PlayerCharacter player, EnemyCharacter enemy);
}

public class PlayerAggressiveStrategy : CombatStrategy{
  \\the aggressive strategy inherits CombatStrategy
  \\this strategy picks the highest damage attack and does it

  public override void TakeTurn(PlayerCharacter player, EnemyCharacter enemy){
	if (enemy.health > 0){
		if (player.mana >= 9){
			player.Ult()
		}
		else if (player.mana >= 6){
			player.Fire()
		}
		else {
			player.Attack()
		}

		enemyscript.charReset()
